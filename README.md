# Loan Status Predictor

This project predicts loan approval based on demographic and financial inputs using different machine learning models.  
The goal is to assist financial institutions in making faster and more reliable lending decisions.

## 📊 Project Overview
- Built models to predict loan approval using demographic and financial inputs.
- Handled missing values and applied label encoding and feature scaling.
- Compared three models using **accuracy**, **precision**, and **F1-score** metrics.
- Best model (**Random Forest**) achieved **70% accuracy**.
